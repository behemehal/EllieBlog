## New updates

### EllieDocs

A new place for documentation. You can visit [here](https://docs.ellie-lang.org/).

### Syntax Shortening

We have come to understanding that some people finds our syntax hard to read. So we will make some changes to the syntax, but old syntax will remain as feature called shortening. Shortening can help people construct their algorithms faster without forgeting it. Lia will provide a tool that turns shortened items to long syntax. 

We want to clarify, original syntax is the short types and nothing will prevent that.

You can read more [here](https://docs.ellie-lang.org/short_type.html#shortening).

Thanks for your attention.
