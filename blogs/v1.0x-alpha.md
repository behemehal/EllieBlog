## Hello again friends!

It's been a long long time since last post I shared. I want to talk a little bit about project's progress and what future be like.

### Why updates are so late?
Im sparing lots of my spare time to ellie but since Im working on full-time job it's getting harder and difficult to maintain both. Sorry about that. But my motivation is high since there is so much people stars on github in such a short time, thanks a lot for that.

You can support behemehal here btw :)

[Behemehal Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/behemehal)

Or me here;

[Ahmetcan Aksu Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/ahmtcn123)

Im very sure that we will have more contributors in the future, the Ellie Robotics Studio will probably hype the project even more.

### Behemehal Public Timeline

You can follow our public timeline in here: [Behemehal Public Timeline](https://github.com/orgs/behemehal/projects/8)


### Whats new about ellie??

1 - EllieID the debugger removed and moved to EllieVM cli.
2 - Classes are now available and works like a charm
3 - Lots of bugs fixed evolving frame pointer and expecting to never occur.
4 - Brand new module interface! Which we cover in below


### Module interface
Ellie's module interface renewed. And developing native modules is better now. 

#### How can I create a native module?

#### 1 - Adding Directly to VM

Assuming this is your file `main.ei`

```ellie
pub fn HelloWorldInput() -> String;
```

Declaring function is enough.

compile with:

`elliec compile ..\..\core.ei --compile-lib -output bin -module-name myNativeLib --insert-module ./core.eib`

This looks like surgical operation gone wrong but `lia` will make every problem go away.

`lia compile` :)

Now rust side;

`vm.rs` will be your vm code.

```rust
//Create a global module manager to store all of the native modules.
let mut module_manager = ModuleManager::new();

//Create your module
let mut my_native_lib = EllieModule::new("myNativeLib".to_string());

my_native_lib.register_element(ModuleElements::Function(FunctionElement::new(
    "HelloWorldInput",
    Box::new(|_, args| {
        // User cant get out of syntax but we're adding this anyways
        if !args.is_empty() {
            return VmNativeAnswer::RuntimeError(
                "Signature mismatch expected 0 argument(s)".to_string(),
            );
        }
        VmNativeAnswer::Ok(
            VmNativeCallParameters::Dynamic(
                RawType::generate_string("Hello There".to_string())
            )
        )
    }),
)));

let mut thread = Thread::new(..., ...);
thread.run(&mut module_manager, ...),
```

Thats it.


### FFI?

FFI support is planned. C, C++ and zig will be available. Same bridge as `ModuleManager` mentionad above will be implemented in zig lang since zig is awsome with existing c codebase. As you can guess FFI is a runtime feature and no support will be available for embedded use. But you're free to copy it from `ellievm`.


### What is Ellie Robotics Studio?

Ellie Robotics Studio will be a one-stop place for robotics usage for ellie. Planned cards are `esp32` `Raspberry pico` and `arm bluepill`.


Thats it folks see you in next release I hope.
